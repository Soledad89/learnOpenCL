AES-OpenCL
==========

An AES implementation in OpenCL. AES-OpenCL - An AES implementation in OpenCL. Supports both ECB and CBC modes.

This is the source code for my Bachelor's diploma.
I did research on accelerating cryptographic algorithms using parallel computing languages (eg. OpenCL), in order  make use of the full power of graphic processing units.
